      <div id="taskOne" class="tabcontent col-8">
        <h2>Task 1: Find today's crossword
        <img src="assets/img/task1.png" width="30%" height="30%"></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Opened left sidebar</li>
          <li>Scrolled through the sections</li>
          <li>Found games under "Living"</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Time spent:</b> 13 seconds</p>

        <p>The user completed the task with relative ease,
          as she already had an idea of where to find the crossword games
          due to her familiarity with similar sites. The menu bars were helpful since
          they highlighted the different sections.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="taskTwo" class="tabcontent col-8">
        <h2>Task 2: Find the terms of service
        <img src="assets/img/task2.png" width="50%" height="50%"></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Opened left sidebar</li>
          <li>Scrolled through briefly, closed it</li>
          <li>Clicked back button</li>
          <li>Tried to scroll all the way down homepage</li>
          <li>Gave up, scrolled back up</li>
          <li>Clicked Account button, closed it</li>
          <li>Opened left sidebar</li>
          <li>Clicked “Tools and Services” header</li>
          <li>Scrolled down</li>
          <li>Found Terms and Services at the bottom </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Time spent:</b> 55 seconds</p>

        <p>The user found this task frustrating and confusing. The more she scrolled
          down the homepage, the more articles it loaded for her instead of taking
          her to the bottom. </p>

        <p><b>Recommendations</b>: The New York Times could include a clear
          but nonintrusive button in the lower right corner that, when clicked,
          takes the user to the bottom of the website.
      </div>

      <div id="taskThree" class="tabcontent col-8">
        <h2>Task 3: Find the trending page
        <img src="assets/img/task3.png" width="40%" height="40%"></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Thought the homepage might be trending page</li>
          <li>Went to homepage by clicking logo</li>
          <li>Couldn’t find search bar there</li>
          <li>Opened left sidebar, found search bar</li>
          <li>Searched “Trending”</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Time spent:</b> 30 seconds</p>

        <p>The intended way to find the trending page is different.
          The trending button is buried in the left sidebar. It’s not intuitive in a way
          a user might expect it to be. </p>

        <p><b>Recommendations</b>: The trending button should be included on the
          navigational bar. Also, the search bar should be available at
          the top of every page.
      </div>

      <div id="taskFour" class="tabcontent col-8">
        <h2>Task 4: Find yesterday's paper
        <img src="assets/img/task4.png" width="30%" height="30%"></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Opened left sidebar</li>
          <li>Looked at “News” section</li>
          <li>Saw (but didn’t click) “Today’s Paper”</li>
          <li>Scrolled down, looked at “Listings and more” section</li>
          <li>Scrolled up again, clicked “Today’s Paper” </li>
          <li>Opened calendar at the top</li>
          <li>Clicked “26th”
        </ol>
        <p><b>Time spent:</b> 34 seconds</p>

        <p>The user did not immediately recognize that clicking "Today's Paper" would lead
          her to a page in which she could change the date of the paper.</p>

        <p><b>Recommendations:</b> The New York Times could include a small but
          noticeable button or link in the shape of an arrow facing left from "Today's"
          Paper." This would easily allow the user to click through previous papers
          without having to use the calender function.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="taskFive" class="tabcontent col-8">
        <h2>Task 5: Go back to the homepage
        <img src="assets/img/task5.png" width="60%" height="60%"></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Clicked on NYT Logo at top of page</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Time spent:</b> 1 second</p>

        <p>As per web design conventions, the large, noticeable
          logo leads to the homepage when clicked. The title of this webpage
          does the same. Try it out!</p>

        <h2>What is a usability test?</h2>
        <p>A usability test is a way to center real users in the user interface
          design process. Researchers give a representative group of these users
          a digital product, such as a website or app, and a series of tasks that
          can be completed with its functions. They observe the users as they
          attempt these tasks, taking note of what functions they struggle with,
          what they find intuitive, how long it takes to complete the task, and
          so on. Above are the results of the New York Times usability test
          conducted by Erina Lee and Evan Rothman, with Emily Schmitt as the user.
          You can toggle between the results of each task on the navigational bar
          above.</p>
